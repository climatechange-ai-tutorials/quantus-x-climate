# Quantus x Climate: Applying Explainable AI Evaluation in Climate Science
In climate science, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can be used to improve and validate deep learning methods, but evaluation and selection of XAI methods is challenging. Learn how to use the explainable AI evaluation package Quantus to compare and select an appropriate XAI for your climate AI research task.
